Metrics.NET
===========

This port is still work in progrss and should not be considered ready for production
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


.NET Port of the awesome [Java metrics library by codahale](https://github.com/dropwizard/metrics)

This port is also inspired and contains code from [Daniel Crenna's port](https://github.com/danielcrenna/metrics-net) of the same library.

I have decided to write another .NET port of the same library since Daniel does not actively maintain metrics-net. 
I've also whanted to better understand the internals of the library and try to provide a better API, more suitable for the .NET world.
