I'm actively using this library in my work projects, but would like to keep the alpha status a little more so I can change my mind about parts of the API._\r\n\r\n###Intro\r\n\r\nThe Metrics.NET library provides a way of instrumenting applications with custom metrics (timers, histograms, counters etc) that can be reported in various ways and can provide insights on what is happening inside a running application. \r\n\r\nThis library is a .NET Port of the awesome Java [metrics library](https://github.com/dropwizard/metrics) by Coda Hale.\r\n\r\nFor a very good introduction on why metrics are necesary I highly recommand Coda Hale's [talk about metrics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czes-oa0yik) and [slides](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2744222/2011-04-09-Metrics-Metrics-Everywhere.pdf).\r\n\r\nThe library is [published on NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Metrics.NET/) can be installed with the following command:\r\n\r\n    Install-Package Metrics.NET\r\n\r\nSupported runtimes: .NET 4.5.1, .NET 4.5, .NET 4.0, Mono 3.4.0 ( tested on OsX )\r\n\r\nThe API of the library might change until a 1.X version will be made available.\r\n\r\n###Visualization Demo\r\n\r\nA demo of the visualization app is available [here](http://www.erata.net/Metrics.NET/demo/). This demo uses fake, generated values for the metrics.\r\n\r\nThe visualization app is also avaliable on github : [Metrics.NET.FlotVisualization](https://github.com/etishor/Metrics.NET.FlotVisualization). \r\n\r\n###Documentation\r\n\r\n* [Available Metrics](https://github.com/etishor/Metrics.NET/wiki/Available-Metrics)\r\n* [Health Checks](https://github.com/etishor/Metrics.NET/wiki/Health-Checks)\r\n* [Metric Visualization](https://github.com/etishor/Metrics.NET/wiki/Metrics-Visualization)\r\n* [Documentation Wiki](https://github.com/etishor/Metrics.NET/wiki/)\r\n\r\n###Quick Usage Sample\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic class SampleMetrics\r\n{\r\n    private readonly Timer timer = Metric.Timer(\"Requests\", SamplingType.FavourRecent, Unit.Requests);\r\n    private readonly Counter counter = Metric.Counter(\"ConcurrentRequests\", Unit.Requests);\r\n\r\n    public void Request(int i)\r\n    {\r\n        this.counter.Increment();\r\n        using (this.timer.NewContext()) // measure until disposed\r\n        {\r\n            // do some work\r\n        }\r\n        this.counter.Decrement();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n###Adapters for other applications\r\n\r\nAdapters integrate Metrics.NET with other libraries & frameworks.\r\n\r\n* [NancyFx.Metrics](https://github.com/etishor/Metrics.NET/wiki/NancyFX-Metrics-Adapter)\r\n\r\n###TODO\r\nA live list of my future plan\r\n\r\n* [done] Provide a few presets to map performance counters to Gauges ( machine info, process info, CLR stats etc )\r\n* [done] Provide a way for error reporting (at least for reports that do IO) - maybe a delegate on the Metric class\r\n* [done] Add metrics for NancyFx request/response size\r\n* [done] Re-factor scheduled report to prevent overlapping\r\n* [done]Provide http endpoint for reporting metrics (based on owin or nancy) together with javascript visualization solution - the idea is to have out-of-the-box metrics visualization in web apps\r\n* [done] Mono compatibility\r\n* [done] health checks\r\n* [done] Improve the javascript visualization app\r\n* Push metrics out of process, to dedicated metrics service\r\n* Investigate the possibility of using zeromq to delegate metrics to another process - for across cluster metrics\r\n* Provide an adapter for hooking into web api for collecting & exposing metrics (this might be delayed as I tend to use NancyFx - but PRs are welcomed)\r\n* Provide an adapter for hooking into asp.net mvc\r\n* Adapter for graphite and other existing solutions for aggregating metrics\r\n* Investigate the possibility of using Redis as an off-process metrics container (the collections behind the metrics seem to map to redis data types)\r\n* Investigate the possibility for backend to receive metrics from client js app (not sure it makes sense to capture metrics from js apps - maybe from SPAs)\r\n* Write more tests\r\n* Find/Implement ConcurrentSkipMap like collection form java - low prio as the performance is good for now\r\n* Write more \"stupid\" benchmarks to be able to keep an eye on how performance changes in time\r\n* Profile & optimize. Also profile existing apps to see the impact of adding metrics\r\n\r\n###License\r\n.NET Port of the awesome [Java metrics library by Coda Hale](https://github.com/dropwizard/metrics)\r\n\r\nThis port is also inspired and contains some code from [Daniel Crenna's port](https://github.com/danielcrenna/metrics-net) of the same library.\r\n\r\nI have decided to write another .NET port of the same library since Daniel does not actively maintain metrics-net. \r\nI've also wanted to better understand the internals of the library and try to provide a better API, more suitable for the .NET world.\r\n\r\nThis port will always keep the same license as the original Java Metrics library.\r\n\r\nThe original metrics project is released under this therms (https://github.com/dropwizard/metrics):\r\nCopyright (c) 2010-2013 Coda Hale, Yammer.com\r\nPublished under Apache Software License 2.0, see LICENSE\r\n\r\nThe Daniel Crenna's idiomatic port is released under this therms (https://github.com/danielcrenna/metrics-net):\r\nThe original Metrics project is Copyright (c) 2010-2011 Coda Hale, Yammer.com\r\nThis idiomatic port of Metrics to C# and .NET is Copyright (c) 2011 Daniel Crenna\r\nBoth works are published under The MIT License, see LICENSE\r\n\r\nThis port ( Metrics.NET ) is release under Apache 2.0 License ( see LICENSE ) \r\nCopyright (c) 2014 Iulian Margarintescu\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-632446-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
